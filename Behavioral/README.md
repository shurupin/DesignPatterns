Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## [Behavioral](/Behavioral)

Patterns that specifically concern the communication between objects.

- [Chain of Responsibility](/Behavioral/ChainOfResponsibility) delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
- [Command](/Behavioral/Command) creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
- [Iterator](/Behavioral/Iterator) accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- [Mediator](/Behavioral/Mediator) allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
- [Memento](/Behavioral/Memento) provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).
- [Observer](/Behavioral/Observer) is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
- [State](/Behavioral/State) allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- [Strategy](/Behavioral/Strategy) allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
- [Template Method](/Behavioral/TemplateMethod) defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
- [Visitor](/Behavioral/Visitor) separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
