## Structural

Patterns that define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- [Adapter](/Structural/Adapter) allows classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- [Bridge](/Structural/Bridge) decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- [Composite](/Structural/Composite) composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
- [Decorator](/Structural/Decorator) dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object.
- [Facade](/Structural/Facade) provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.
- [Flyweight](/Structural/Flyweight) reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- [Proxy](/Structural/Proxy) provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.
