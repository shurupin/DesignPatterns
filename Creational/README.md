## Creational

Patterns that flexibly create and instantiate objects.

- [Abstract Factory](/Creational/AbstractFactory) groups object factories that have a common theme.
- [Builder](/Creational/Builder) constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
- [Factory Method](/Creational/FactoryMethod) creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
- [Prototype](/Creational/Prototype) creates objects by cloning an existing object.
- [Singleton](/Creational/Singleton) restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
